\Abst{Exact and approximate based on normal approximation and statistical linearization,  
algorithms for distibutions with invariant measure analytical modeling in nongaussian 
stochastic systems (StS) with discontinious characteristics are developed. Peculiarities 
in Poisson StS are considered. Test examples confirms the practical accuracy of algorithms.}
