By a special decision of the editorial
board, some articles can be published in English.


The topics covered include the following areas:
\begin{itemize}
               \item
     theoretical fundamentals of informatics; \\[-14pt]
\item
mathematical methods for studying complex systems and processes; \\[-14pt]
\item
information systems and networks;\\[-14pt]
\item
information technologies; and \\[-14pt]

following form:

{\bfseries\textit{Agreement on the transfer of rights to publish:}}

``\textit{We, the undersigned authors of the manuscript ``\ldots'', pass to the
Founder and the Editorial Board of the Journal ``Informatics and Applications''
the nonexclusive right to publish the manuscript of the article in Russian (or
in English) in both print and electronic versions of the Journal. We affirm
that this publication does not violate the Copyright of other persons or

\item The Editorial Board of the Journal examines the article according to the established
reviewing procedure. If the authors receive their article for correction after reviewing, it does not
mean that the article is approved for publication. The corrected article should be sent to the
Editorial Board for the subsequent review and approval.\\[-13.5pt]

\item The decision on the article publication or its rejection is communicated to the authors. The
Editorial Board may also send the reviews on the submitted articles to the authors. Any
discussion upon the rejected articles is not possible.\\[-13.5pt]
