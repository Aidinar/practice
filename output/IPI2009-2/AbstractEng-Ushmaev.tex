Abstract. We consider problem of biometric system adjusting to the variable operational environment. 
The impact of operational distortion is analyzed. As an example, we consider automatic fingerprint 
identification. The general approach for operation distortion registration is suggested. Basing on the 
approach, we developed method for adjusting of a biometric system. We carry out experiments that show 
effectiveness of the suggested approach. 

Keywords. biometrics; automatic fingerprint identification; recognition distortions
