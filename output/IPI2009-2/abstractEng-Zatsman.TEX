SEMIOTIC MODEL FOR COMPUTER CODING CONCEPTS AND INFORMATION OBJECTS 
I.\,M.~Zatsman
The semiotic model, which has been developed during research of problems of 
generation and evolution of goal-oriented knowledge systems in digital libraries 
and other kinds of information systems, is considered. These problems concern to 
the new direction of the researches, which have named ``Cognitive Informatics.?? 
The semiotic model suggested is intended for the description of computer coding 
concepts and information objects. This model is positioned as theoretical 
foundations for development of methods of the three-component coding denotata, 
concepts and information objects, including construction of one-to-one 
correspondence between concepts of goal-oriented knowledge systems and 
computer codes.
