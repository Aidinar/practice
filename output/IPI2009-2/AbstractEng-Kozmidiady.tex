Backup using Snapshots

Summary: Complication of the reserve copying (backup), using differences
between two successive snapshots is examined in the article. A formal model
in which it is possible exactly to put a problem is offered. An algorithm,
which decides this problem for almost linear time of the volume of
differences, is offered.
