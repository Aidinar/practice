MULTI-CHANNEL QUEUEING SYSTEM WITH A FINITE BUFFER, A LOCKOUT OF AN INPUT FLOW AND A KNOCKOUT
OF CUSTOMERS FROM THE BUFFER

V.~Chaplygin

A multi-channel queueing system with a finite buffer, a lockout of a semi-Markovian input
flow and a knockout of customers from the buffer by a first customer arrived into the system over the
period when the input flow is unlocked is considered. The periods of lockout and the periods when
the input flow is unlocked have an exponential distribution with different intensities. The main
stationary characteristics such as a queue distribution, a loss probability, a mean sojourn time are
found.
