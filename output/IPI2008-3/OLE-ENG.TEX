STRUCTURAL MATRIX SYSTEMS DECOMPOSION
Anatoly Olenin
In the article one of possible approaches to matrix systems parallelizing by their structural
decomposion on set of the subsystems, independent calculating at the certain stage is
considered. The constructive algorithm of the decomposition method is formulated and the
estimation of its computing expenses is given.
