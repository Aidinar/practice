The main goal of this paper is to present a new design verification methodology for complicated digital
systems, designed by high level synthesis. This methodology is based on Algorithmic State Machine (ASM)
transformations (composition, minimization, extraction, etc.), special algorithms for Data Path and Control Unit design
and very fast optimizing synthesis of finite state machines  (FSM) and combinational circuits with hardly any constraints
on their size, that is, the number of inputs, outputs and states. Design tools supporting this methodology allow very fast
implement, check and estimate many possible design versions, to find an optimized decision of the design problem and
to simplify the verification problem for digital systems.
 In contrast to existent semi-formal approaches to verification of industrial systems, based on combination of simulation
and formal verification approaches, we consider a formalized method based on concurrency of synthesis and verification
that is providing regular efficient way to verify the system designed properties starting from its semi-formal specification
up to FPGA implementation.
