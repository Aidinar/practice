In the present paper we
heuristically obtain a formula (see (3.1)) for the limit of
the difference between the  power of the asymptotically optimal test and
the power of the asymptotically most powerful (AMP) test for the case
of generalized Laplace
distribution. This difference has the order $n^{-1/2}$ due to the
nonregularity of this distribution, in contrast to regular laws
for which this order equals  $n^{-1}$.
\par Key words: generalized Laplace or
generalized double exponential distribution, power
function, deficiency, asymptotic expansion.
