      <text value="Some Implementation Aspects of the Connecting Medium in the Decentralized Packet Switching Architecture Abstract: Specific requirements to the connecting medium in the decentralized packet switching architecture are defined. Some medium implementation aspects are discussed. Special attention is paid to high-speed serial interfaces used as a connecting medium, with a reduced version of such an interface assigned to packet switching being proposed. Keywords: packet switch, decentralized switching, integrated communications controller, super-local network, high-speed serial interface."/>
