      <text value="M. Agalarov Annotation: Considered a model of packet commutation node with repetitive transmissions for two schemes of buffer memory distributions: fully accessible and fully shared. Proposed approximate method of calculation of stream intensity and probabilities of node blocking. Derived necessity and sufficiency conditions for existence and unicity of solution of equation for streams in node when operating regime became established, and proved convergence of iteration method for solving proposed equation. Keywords: packet commutation node, buffer memory, repetitive transmissions, probabilities of blocking, iteration method"/>
