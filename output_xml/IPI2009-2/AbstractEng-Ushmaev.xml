      <text value="S. Ushmaev (Institute for Informatics Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences) Abstract. We consider problem of biometric system adjusting to the variable operational environment. The impact of operational distortion is analyzed. As an example, we consider automatic fingerprint identification. The general approach for operation distortion registration is suggested. Basing on the approach, we developed method for adjusting of a biometric system. We carry out experiments that show effectiveness of the suggested approach. Keywords. biometrics; automatic fingerprint identification; recognition distortions"/>
