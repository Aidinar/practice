      <text value="N. Gorkavyi$^2$1 IPI RAN, sukhomlin@mail.ru 2 M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University, ilya_gor@rambler.ru New approach to development of software suites for automatic processing of LIDAR data is considered. The elaborated algorithms for classification of 3D data and generation of high quality models of bare-Earth relief are described, tools for visualization of 3D models and interactive correction of models by operator are presented. The paper discusses goals, achieved results and perspectives of new approach. Keywords: Аutomatic data processing; classification methods; three-dimensional models; LIDAR; laser scanning"/>
